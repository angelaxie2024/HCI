                <p> Hi! Welcome to my website! </p>
                <p> My name is Angela Xie and I am a junior at Northwestern University studying Neuroscience and Computer Science, with aspirations to pursue medicine.</p>
                <p> I currently work at the Schmidt Lab studying retinal ganglion cells and their effect on the optokinetic reflex. I am also involved with a multitidue of tutoring and volunteering work. My computer science and tech experiences include two past summer internships.</p>
                <p> Outside of school, I love to dance. Growing up, I was trained in ballet, jazz, tap, contemporary, lyrical, and even ballroom! I am in multiple dance groups at Northwestern, focused on hip hop dancing. I often lead and choreograph dances for the largest student-run dance shows on campus.</p>
                <p> If you want to check out some of my choreography projects, continue on to the projects section!</p>

            <div class = "desc1"> 
                <p> Project 1 is a dance that me and my roommate choreographed to "Bloodline" by Ariana Grande </p>
                <p> This dance is a hip hop piece that incorporates femme styles.</p>
                <p> The cast consisted of 25 dancers that all chose to learn this piece.</p>
                <p> Bloodline was performed to sold-out crowds of thousands, as part of Northwestern's largest dance show.</p>
                <p> To watch this piece, learn more about the choreography process, or just get more information about this project, click the title "Project 1" to see more.</p>

                <p> Project 2 is the dance that I choreographed with my friend this year to "We Go Up" by Nicki Minaj. </p>
                <p> This dance is also a hip hop piece, but unlike last year, it incorporates both masc and femme styles.</p>
                <p> The cast consisted of 17 dancers that learned the choreography over the course of the quarter.</p>
                <p> We Go Up was also performed to sold-out crowds of thousands, as part of Northwestern's largest dance show.</p>
                <p> Unfortunately, this piece has not been uploaded on youtube and cannot be watched at this time.</p>
