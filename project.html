    <p> "Bloodline" was my first time choreographing a full piece for the stage. I choreographed this dance with my roommate last year for our dance team "Fusion Dance Company."
        We spent all of fall quarter choreographing, teaching, leading, and cleaning this dance, and spent many hours mulling over how to improve the piece. 
        All our efforts culminated in seeing our cast of 25 phenomenal dancers bring this piece onstage at "Refusionshaka," Northwestern's biggest dance show.
    </p>
    <p>Choreographing with someone else made my first time much more approachable. 
        Working together, we were able to collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project cultivated my love for choreographing and teaching, and it was very fulfilling to see all our hard work translated into such a great piece in the show!
